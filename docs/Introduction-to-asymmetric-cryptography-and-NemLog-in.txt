*** Introduction to asymmetric cryprography and NemLog-in
**** Overview

     - Main problem solved by using cryptography (encryption/signing)
       - Facilitates bidirectional exchange of messages (XML documents)
         over an unsecure medium (the Internet) and through unsecure
         intermediaries (web browsers).

     - Main problem solved by using SAML
       - XML dialect for request/response exchange of messages with a
         central service (identity provider). The identity provider
         owns its user database such that applications (service
         providers) doesn't have to.

     - Other well-known identity providers
       - Office 365, Facebook, Google
       - Kerberos authentication (part of Windows AD)
         - klist Windows command

     - Cryptographic system using pairs of keys
       - Public key to be distributed freely
       - Private key known only to owner

     - Key generation (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Public-key-crypto-1.svg)
     - Encryption and decryption (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Public_key_encryption.svg)
       - Only the holder of the paired private key can decrypt a
         message encrypted with the public key.
     - Signing and validation (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/Digital_Signature_diagram.svg)
       - Public key is used to verify that a holder of the paired
         private key sent the message.
       - Combine a message with a computation using the private key to
         create a short digital signature on the message.
       - Message is signed with the sender's private key and can be
         verified by anyone who has access to the sender's public key.
         Otherwise, message could've come from anyone with access to
         the public key.

**** Request / response SAML example

     - Example request

       <?xml version="1.0"?>
       <q1:AuthnRequest ID="idea1e6977f4b541e0b52a04ae1d8a95b9" Version="2.0" IssueInstant="2017-10-27T06:55:09.0009Z" Destination="https://login.test-nemlog-in.dk/adfs/ls/" ForceAuthn="false" IsPassive="false" xmlns:q1="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol">
         <Issuer xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion">https://saml.oiosaml-net.dk</Issuer>
           <Conditions xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion">
             <AudienceRestriction>
               <Audience>https://saml.oiosaml-net.dk</Audience>
             </AudienceRestriction>
           </Conditions>
         </Issuer>
       </q1:AuthnRequest>

     - Example response (part of large XML document)

       <AttributeStatement xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion">
         <Attribute Name="urn:oid:2.5.4.3" NameFormat="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:basic">
           <AttributeValue>Tille Jepsen</AttributeValue>
         </Attribute>
         <Attribute Name="urn:oid:0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.1" NameFormat="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:basic">
           <AttributeValue>PID:9208-2002-2-884449999417</AttributeValue>
         </Attribute>
       </AttributeStatement>
 
**** Required keys / certificates

     - Sender                Receiver
        K_sender_enc_pub      K_receiver_enc_pub            
        K_sender_enc_pri      K_receiver_enc_pri
        
        K_sender_sig_pub      K_receiver_sig_pub
        K_sender_sig_pri      K_receiver_sig_pri

       No technical difference between enc and sig certificates --
       it's a designation of usage. In principle, certificates may
       be switched or the same certificate may be used for both
       encryption and signing.

       Pub/pri pair grouped in a certificate (file, container).
       Certificate is oftentimes password protected if it contains
       a private key.

       Certificate may itself be signed with another certificate to
       construct a chain of trust up to a root authority.
       
     - Above encrypting/signing happens within the TCP/IP application
       layer.

     - Transport/session layer encryption of communication happens too (http://bpastudio.csudh.edu/fac/lpress/471/hout/netech/tcpvosi2.gif)
       
     - Server              Client  
        K_server_tls_pub    K_client_tls_pub
        K_server_tls_pri    K_client_tls_pri

       With TLS, payload isn't actually encrypted/decrypted using
       asymetric cryptography. Only the initial exchange of the session
       key is. After initial exchange, symmetric encryption is used
       for speed.

       Symmetric encryption uses a single secret key, which must be
       shared and kept private by both the sender (for encryption) and
       the receiver (for decryption).

**** Algorithm for A -> B transmission 

     From A -> B

     On A:
     0. Assume XML document constructed by application (valid SAML request or response)
     1. Compute SHA256 hash of (0)
     2. Encrypt (1) using K_A_sig_pri
     3. Append (0) to (2)
     4. Encrypt (3) with K_B_enc_pub
     5. Transmit (4) using query string (or HTTP form POST)

     On B:
     0. Assume received encrypted cipher text
     1. Decrypt (0) using K_B_enc_pri
     2. Compute SHA256 of (0) excluding the signature part of XML
     3. Decrypt signature using K_A_sig_pub
     4. Compare (2) with with (3)
     5. Application-level processing of XML document
   
     Any one with access to the public key could've sent a massage. By
     verifying the signature, we know that the message was sent by
     someone who holds A's private key which, hopefully, is A only.

     Each message includes both an unique ID and a timestamp, making
     replay attacks hard as a single character change to clear text
     message produces a vastly different SHA hash value and because
     the SHA hash is a one-way function.

**** Certification Revocation List

     - Three-way TCP handshake required to connect to CRL server
     - Connection tracking table of network equipment at service side often
       prevents connections originating from inside the network
     - Four tuple of (Src IP, Src port, Dst IP, Dst port) per connection
       doesn't exist in connection tracking table 

**** How public keys are distributed and located by parties

     Run through steps of above algorithm.

     + IdP metadata (https://svn.softwareborsen.dk/oiosaml.net/trunk/src/dk.nita.saml20/WebsiteDemo/idp-metadata/Test-nemlog-in-2.xml)
       - K_IdP_enc_pub
       - K_IdP_sig_pub 

     + SP metadata (examples below)
       - K_SP_enc_pub
       - K_SP_sig_pub
     
     Example: extract base 64 encoded part of metadata and save as
     .cer file to inspect certificate (using associated file handler
     or certutil command).

     Metadata isn't secret (it's public keys + service
     description). Metadata is downloaded by calling into the
     metadata.ashx handler, part of oiosaml.net.

     Strictly speaking, metadata.ashx endpoint isn't required for the
     service to operate but useful for debugging.

     Private keys are stored in the Windows certificate store on IdP
     and SP servers and must be made accessible to the IIS app pool
     user.

     HTTPS = SSL = TLS certificates are stored in certificate store as
     well.
